Otherwise, even though someone may have indicated one book as 1 star, the model will still see it as something that the user interacted with and use the 1 as a confidence level, so similar books could still be recommended. Since over half the reviews are 4 and 5 stars, it seems worth using just those in the data. I decided to keep the actual values as 4 and 5, giving the concept of confidence and shifting recommendations more towards 5-star reviews. "
